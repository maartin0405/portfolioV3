                    I'm a front-end developer based in Chomutov Czechia. I can develop responsive websites from scratch and raise them into modern user-friendly web experiences. Iâ€™m always excited to take on new challenges and expand my portfolio.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I strive for perfection in every project I work on, paying attention to the smallest details. Working with others motivates me even more, as working with people brings fresh challenges that push me to deliver the best results possible.
